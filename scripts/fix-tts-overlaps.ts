// This script documents all the TTS overlap issues and fixes needed

/*
IDENTIFIED TTS OVERLAP ISSUES:

1. LIFELINE HANDLERS - Multiple nested speech calls
   - fiftyFifty: speaks intro, then "Computer, please remove..." in onEnd
   - phone: speaks intro, then hint after timeout
   - askAudience: speaks intro, then "Audience, please vote...", then results

2. QUESTION LOADING - Multiple sequential speeches
   - Host intro speech
   - Then question/options speech in onEnd callback (can overlap)

3. NO STOP() CALLS BEFORE NEW SPEECH
   - handleFinalAnswer doesn't stop before speaking
   - confirmFinalAnswer doesn't stop before speaking  
   - Lifelines don't stop current speech

4. MIXED speak() vs speakImmediate()
   - Some use speak (queues), others speakImmediate (immediate)
   - Inconsistent behavior

FIXES NEEDED:

1. Add stop() before EVERY speech call
2. Use speakImmediate() consistently (no queuing)
3. Remove nested speech in callbacks - combine messages
4. Add isSpeaking state to prevent overlaps
5. Consolidate lifeline messages into single speech

// FIX 1: Update loadQuestion to combine messages

stop(); // Always stop first
speakImmediate(hostIntroAndQuestion, { voice: 'echo', speed: 0.9 });

// FIX 2: Update fiftyFifty lifeline
const useFiftyFifty = () => {
  if (!lifelines.fiftyFifty || !currentQuestion) return;
  
  stop(); // Stop any current speech
  const message = "Let me help you out here. Computer, please remove two wrong answers.";

  const toEliminate = wrongAnswers.slice(0, 2);

// FIX 3: Update phone lifeline
const usePhoneAFriend = () => {

  stop(); // Stop any current speech

// FIX 4: Update audience lifeline

  stop(); // Stop any current speech

  // Generate poll immediately

// FIX 5: Add stop() to all speech triggers
