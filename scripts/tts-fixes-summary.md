# TTS Multiple Voice Fixes - Summary

## Problems Fixed

### 1. **Question Loading - Nested Speech Calls**
**Before:** Host intro spoke, then question/options in onEnd callback (could overlap)
**Fixed:** Combined intro and question into single speech call

### 2. **Lifeline Handlers - Multiple Sequential Speech**
**Before:** Each lifeline had 2-3 nested speech calls that could overlap
**Fixed:** 
- **50:50:** Combined intro + "Computer remove answers" into one speech
- **Phone:** Combined intro + friend's hint into one speech  
- **Audience:** Combined intro + "vote now" into one speech, results announced separately with stop()

### 3. **Missing stop() Calls**
**Before:** New speech started without stopping previous speech
**Fixed:** Added stop() before EVERY speakImmediate call:
- loadQuestion()
- useFiftyFifty()
- usePhoneAFriend()
- useAskAudience()
- handleTimeUp()
- handleWalkAway()

### 4. **Inconsistent speak() vs speakImmediate()**
**Before:** Mixed usage causing queuing issues
**Fixed:** Changed all speak() to speakImmediate() for consistent immediate playback

### 5. **Timer Messages**
**Note:** Timer messages at 10 and 30 seconds only set visual host message, don't trigger speech
This prevents them from interrupting ongoing speech (good design)

## Key Principles Applied

1. **Always stop() first** - Before any new speech, call stop() to cancel current speech
2. **Combine related messages** - Instead of chaining speech in callbacks, combine into one message
3. **Use speakImmediate consistently** - No queuing, immediate playback
4. **Separate visual from audio** - Host messages can appear without speech (timer warnings)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Start game - intro and first question should not overlap
- [ ] Use 50:50 lifeline - single continuous speech
- [ ] Use Phone lifeline - intro and hint in one speech
- [ ] Use Audience lifeline - intro speech, then results after delay
- [ ] Let timer run to 30 seconds - visual message only, no speech overlap
- [ ] Let timer run to 10 seconds - visual message only, no speech overlap
- [ ] Select answer quickly during speech - should stop current speech
- [ ] Walk away during speech - should stop and play walk away message

## Files Modified

- `/app/game/millionaire-game.tsx`
  - loadQuestion() - lines 347-356
  - useFiftyFifty() - lines 632-657
  - usePhoneAFriend() - lines 659-679
  - useAskAudience() - lines 681-731

## Result

The game should now have clean, non-overlapping TTS with:
- Single voice speaking at a time
- Immediate cancellation when user takes action
- Smooth transitions between different speech segments
- No competing voices or audio overlap
